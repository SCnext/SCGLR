# SCGLR

[![CRAN_Status_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/SCGLR)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=SCGLR)

## Introduction

**SCGLR** is an open source implementation of the Supervised Component Generalized Linear Regression 
[@bry13;-@bry16;-@bry18], which identifies the most predictive dimensions among a large set of predictors potentially multicolinear. **SCGLR** is an extension of partial least square regression (PLSR) to the uni- and multivariate generalized linear framework. PLSR is particularly well suited for analyzing a large array of related predictor variables and many studies have demonstrated its ability for prediction in various biological fields such as genetic [@boulesteix07] or ecology [@carrascal09].  While PLSR is well adapted for continuous variables, maximizing the correlation between dependent variables, Y, and covariates, X, **SCGLR** is suited for non-Gaussian outcomes and non-continuous covariates. It is a model-based approach that extends PLS [@tenenhaus98], PCA on instrumental variables [@sabatier89], canonical correspondence analysis [@terbraak87], and other related empirical methods, by capturing the trade-off between goodness-of-fit and common structural relevance among covariates. The notion of structural strength has been extended to structural relevance by [@bry15].   


## Installation

``` r
# Install realease version from CRAN
install.packages("SCGLR")

# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("billy34/SCGLR")
```

## Main functions and works in progress
**SCGLR** is designed to deal with outcomes from multiple distributions: Gaussian, Bernoulli, binomial and Poisson separetly or simultaneousy [@bry13]. Moereover **SCGLR** is also able to deal with multiple conceptually homogenous variable groups [@bry18].  **SCGLR** is a set of **R** functions illustrated on a floristic data set, _genus_. `scglr` and `scglrTheme` are respectively dedicated to fitting the model with one or more thematic group of regressors. `scglrCrossVal` and `scglrThemeBackward` are respectively dedicated to selecting the number of components. `print`, `summary` and `plot` methods are also available for the `scglr` and `scglrTheme` function results.

Different works are in progress both dealing with the inclusion of random effects extending **SCGLR** to generalized linear mixed model framework [@chauvet18;-@chauvet18b].
